    /*
    Explanation:

    setTimeout is a function in JavaScript used to schedule a function (or a code snippet) to execute after a specified delay.

        Syntax:
        setTimeout(callbackFunction, delay);

        setTimeout(function() {
            // Code to be executed after delay
        }, delay_in_milliseconds);

        Example:

        javascript

        // Example: Print a message after 3 seconds
        setTimeout(function() {
            console.log("Hello after 3 seconds!");
        }, 3000); // 3000 milliseconds = 3 seconds
    
    */
    // setTimeout method also calls the API 

    // setTimeout(()=> console.log("Anjan First delayed") , 2000 )
    // console.log("Anjan Second");

    const sayAnjan = () => console.log("Anjan  delayed and passed as ref call back");

    const changeText = () => {
        document.querySelector('h1').innerText = 'Anjan code JS';
        console.log("Text changed Successfully with the execution of setTimeout")
    }

    // setTimeout(sayAnjan, 3000)
    const changeMe = setTimeout(changeText, 3000)

    const clearMe =  () => {
        clearTimeout(changeMe)
        console.log('stopped by clearTimeout');
    };
    
     const stopBtn = document.querySelector("#stop")

     stopBtn.addEventListener('click', clearMe)

    Summary of Key Points:

    Function Block: If setTimeout is inside a function, the callback is scheduled for execution only when that function is called. Until the parent function is invoked, the setTimeout and its callback do nothing.

    Timeout Execution: Once the parent function is executed, the setTimeout starts its timer based on the specified delay. After that delay, the callback function executes.

    Variable Storage: Storing the timeout ID in a variable allows you to manage the timeout (e.g., cancel it with clearTimeout) later on, but the execution of the callback still depends on the timer.

        So, the scheduled function will run after the specified time only if the surrounding function (where setTimeout is defined) is executed first. This makes setTimeout quite flexible for use in various scenarios. Great job understanding it!


    anjan's messy explainiton after clearing doubt haha:
        When setTimeout is inside a function, the scheduled execution of the callback function occurs only when that outer function is called. 

        oh thats what i was askin 
        i got it unless it is wrapped under the block of code it wont run unless the parnet is executed 

        but if it is intialzed into the variable to move around it will execute with the certain time of according to the argument is passed into it

    setInterval Method

        Explanation:

            setInterval is a function in JavaScript that repeatedly executes a function (or a code snippet) at a specified interval.

        Syntax:

        let intervalId = setInterval(function() {
            // Code to be executed at each interval
        }, interval_in_milliseconds);

        
        
        Example:

        // Example: Print a count every second, stop after 5 counts
        let counter = 0;
        let intervalId = setInterval(function() {
            counter++;
            console.log("Interval count:", counter);
            if (counter === 5) {
                clearInterval(intervalId); // Stops the interval after 5 counts
            }
        }, 1000); // 1000 milliseconds = 1 second
    


        => clearInterval Method

            Explanation:

                clearInterval is used to stop the execution of a function set by setInterval.

            Syntax:

            clearInterval(intervalId);


            Example:

            // Example: Stop the interval after 3 seconds
            let intervalId = setInterval(function() {
                console.log("Running...");
            }, 1000); // Execute every 1 second

            // Stop the interval after 3 seconds
            setTimeout(function() {
                clearInterval(intervalId);
                console.log("Interval stopped after 3 seconds.");
            }, 3000); // 3000 milliseconds = 3 seconds


            setTimeout is for executing a function once after a delay.
            
            setInterval is for executing a function repeatedly at regular intervals.
